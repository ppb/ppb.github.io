# PyCon Stickers!

Just because we can't see in person doesn't mean we should deprive you of
wonderful stickers.

Just fill in your details below and we will send you an envelope full of black
circle adhesive beauties!

We do apologize, but we can only mail to the US.

<form name="stickers" class="table" method="POST" action="/stickers/accepted.html" netlify netlify-honeypot="phone">
    <p style="display:none;">
        <label>Don’t fill this out if you’re a person: <input name="phone" /></label>
    </p>

    <label for=email>Email:</label> <input type="email" name="email" placeholder="binny@ppb.dev" />
    <label for=address>Address:</label> <textarea name="address" rows=4></textarea>
